;;; Commentary:

;; http://pinboard.in is an awesome tool for bookmarking with lots of
;; extensions. This Emacs extension let's you pull the data into a
;; creole-mode file presented in a creole like way.

;; I use it for making quick blog posts of stuff I've pinboarded.

;; I expect there are other uses that I'll add.

;;; Code:

(require 'web)
(require 'json)
(require 'creole-mode)

(defgroup pinboard nil
  "Pull data from pinboard.in."
  :group 'applications)

(defcustom pinboard-url
  (format "http://feeds.pinboard.in/json/u:%s/?count=10" user-login-name)
  "Your pinboard.in user, by default it's Emacs `user-login-name'."
  :group 'pinboard)

(defun pinboard/data (data)
  "The data is a vector of alists."
  (with-current-buffer (get-buffer-create "*pinboard-latest*")
    (let ((buffer-read-only nil))
      (erase-buffer)
      (loop for al across data
         do
           (progn
             (setf (car (assoc 't al)) 'tags)
             (destructuring-bind (&key tags a dt n d u)
                 (kvalist->plist al)
               (insert
                (format "=== %s ===
[[%s|%s]]
//%s//
%s
%s\n\n" n u n dt d (mapconcat 'identity tags "|"))))))
      (creole-mode)
      (visual-line-mode)
      (goto-char (point-min))
      (view-mode)
      (switch-to-buffer (current-buffer)))))

                (insert data)
